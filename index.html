  <h1>A Day as Arya's Momma</h1>
  <div id="content">
    <div id="left_panel">
      <div class="Morning">
        <h2>Morning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>7:30am Arya wakes up.</li>
          <li>7:40am Momma gets up to get Arya's bottle ready, give a good morning kiss, and change her diaper.</li>
          <li>7:45am Arya has her first bottle on the porch. When she's done, we rock for a while watching the birds.</li>
          <li>8:15am Play time for Arya while Momma spends some time with Jesus.</li>
          <li>9:00am We go inside and Momma has breakfast while Arya plays in the living room.</li>
          <li>9:30am Momma gets dressed and does her makeup and hair so she can feel good about going in public.</li>
          <li>10:00am Arya has bottle number 2 and gets a diaper change before going down for nap number 1.</li>
          <li>10-12pm Momma has free time. Sometimes I get chores done, or mow the grass, or do some online shopping, or work
            on CoderGirl tasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="Afternoon">
        <h2>Afternoon</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>12:00pm Arya wakes up, eats, and gets another diaper change.</li>
          <li>12-2pm Shopping time! This is when we get to go out and run errands before Arya has to take another nap.</li>
          <li>2:00pm Arya eats, gets a diaper change, and goes down for nap number 2.</li>
          <li>4:00pm Arya wakes up, eats, gets a diaper change (sounding repetitive yet?).</li>
          <li>4-5pm Arya plays.</li>
          <li>5:00pm Arya eats actual food. Gotta try those new flavors!</li>
          <li>5:30pm Bath time!</li>
          <li>6:00pm Eat, diaper change, down for the night with a song and a kiss.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="Evening">
        <h2>Evening</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>6:00pm This is also about when Chris gets home.</li>
          <li>6:00-10:00pm We watch some tv, eat dinner, talk, sit on the porch, and just in general hang out.</li>
          <li>10:00pm I head to bed. Brush my teeth, wash my face. Read the next chapter in my riveting book that I read to go
            to sleep, but hate putting down when I do.</li>
        </ul>
